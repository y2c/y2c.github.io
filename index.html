<p>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio site of sorts, because I like making things and documentation is always a good thing. Here are some projects I've worked on (including this website itself, which is powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> and some old fashioned hand-typed CSS). I've chosen to include only the larger projects for brevity's sake, and I hope you enjoy reading about them!</p>
