<p>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio site of sorts, because I like making things and documentation is always a good thing. Here are some projects I've worked on (including this website itself, which is powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> and some old fashioned hand-typed CSS).</p>

        <h3>S.B. Mechanical Engineering, 2012</h3>
At MIT, I studied Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in EE/Robotics. I was also a lab assistant for 6.115 (Microcontrollers Lab) and 2.678 (Electronics for Mechanical Engineers).
        <br><br>
        Some classes I took at the 'tvte:
        <ul>
            <li>2.72 - Elements of Mechanical Design</li>
            <li>2.75 - Precision Machine Design</li>
            <li>6.115 - Microcontrollers Lab</li>
            <li>6.131 - Power Electronics</li>
            <li>MAS.863 - How to Make [Almost] Anything</li>
            <li>6.302 - Feedback Systems</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>M.S. Electrical Engineering, in progress</h3>
        I am currently pursuing a Master's in Electrical Engineering. I plan on exploring a few areas across the discipline, and hope to take many lab classes along the way. I have a general interest in learning more about energy applications.
